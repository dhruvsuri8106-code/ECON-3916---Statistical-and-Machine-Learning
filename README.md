# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge traditional economic theory with modern data science methodologies.

## 👋 About Me

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about applying data-driven approaches to economic problems. I'm actively seeking opportunities in **[Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance]** where I can leverage both rigorous economic thinking and cutting-edge analytical tools.

My goal is to become a practitioner who can seamlessly move between causal inference questions ("*What causes what?*") and predictive modeling challenges ("*What will happen next?*").

## 📚 About This Portfolio

This repository contains coursework, labs, and projects from my statistical and machine learning course. Our curriculum follows a **"Concept Extension"** philosophy:

- **Foundation First**: We start with core statistical concepts you'd find in any econometrics course (OLS regression, hypothesis testing, causality)
- **Scale with ML**: We then extend these ideas using machine learning algorithms that handle complexity, high-dimensionality, and prediction at scale (Lasso, Ridge, Random Forests)
- **Economic Application**: Every technique is grounded in real economic questions—labor markets, policy evaluation, demand forecasting, and more

Through this approach, I'm learning to:
- Build predictive models without sacrificing interpretability
- Apply causal inference methods to answer "why" questions
- Scale traditional econometric techniques to modern, large datasets
- Communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **Statsmodels** - Statistical modeling and econometric analysis
- **Google Colab** - Cloud-based development environment
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Reproducible research and documentation

## 📂 Repository Structure

*[You can add sections here as your repository grows, such as:]*
- `/labs` - Weekly lab assignments
- `/projects` - Course projects and case studies
- `/notes` - Personal study notes and summaries

## 🚀 What's Next

I'm continuously updating this repository as I progress through the course. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss economics, data science, or potential collaboration opportunities!
